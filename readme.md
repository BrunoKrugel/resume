# Cover

I am an experienced Backend Developer with a versatile skill set encompassing Java, Javascript, TypeScript, COBOL, ABAP, and Go. Currently, I work full time as a Go developer, focusing on building REST APIs, microservices, and seamlessly integrating systems across diverse protocols and technologies.

My workflow is powered by Docker, Kubernetes, Git, and CI/CD tools like Jenkins and Gitlab CI, ensuring efficient development processes. I have hands-on experience with AWS and Cloud Foundry for deployment, while monitoring is accomplished through Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog. I use Uber Zap and Logrus for logging, K6 for load testing, and Litmus for Chaos Engineering.

My expertise extends to project migrations, including the successful transition of Java projects to Go. I've worked extensively with various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and ElasticSearch. Additionally, I've optimized system performance by migrating HTTP APIs to gRPC and have experience with diverse message brokers like RabbitMQ, Kafka, and SQS.

I am excited to bring my broad technical background and problem-solving skills to contribute effectively to your goals.
